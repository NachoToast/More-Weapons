BetterInspect:
		By default this is off. Due to hard-coded limitations in-game, it's impossible to modify player data, this includes
		changing the nbt data of items in the player's inventory, such as changing the lore text of an item they are holding,
		(lore text is the text shown where the enchantments are). Because of this limitation, the only way (normally) that
		you can view the soul group levels of the scythe is by dropping it, and it'll display the info in chat.

		BetterInspect is a workaround for this, it works by summoning the item at the players location instead of directly
		giving it to them using the replaceitem command. It's a little more complicated than that however, as the game
		cannot directly copy a numerical scoreboard value (i.e. the soul group level of the player) to a text field (i.e.
		the lore of the soul scythe), without using something to first convert the numerical data into text data. 

		This is where the sign comes in, when the BetterInspect function is called (such as when a player looks at a specific
		entity or upgrades a specific soul group level), it spawns a sign at y=0 at the player's position and encodes their
		scoreboard data onto the sign, and then copies the sign's text data onto the lore data of the summoned scythe at the
		player's feet. Afterwards the sign is replaced with bedrock or air (if in the end dimension).

		The reason this is off by default is that summoning a sign, albeit temporarily, might cause some issues in worlds where
		bedrock does not normally exist at y=0 (such as custom generated terrains for example). So while it is recommended to
		turn BetterInspect on, do not do so if you're running a specially generated world, or check with someone who is familiar
		with the generation settings of that world before enabling BetterInspect (You can also ask NachoToast to make a patch
		for the world, if all else fails).

		You can turn BetterInspect off at any time with the command `/scoreboard players reset #ntcs.betterinspect`
		You can turn BetterInspect on at any time with the command `/scoreboard players set #ntcs.betterinspect ntcs.temp 1`

BetterHotbar:
	By default this is off, and is only applicable to worlds where BetterInspect is enabled. Because BetterInspect uses
	summoning functions to give the player the scythe, instead of replaceitem, the scythe (when it is picked up by the
	player) will by default be put in the first free hotbar slot of the player. This is a very minor annoyance, especially
	if the player wants their lower hotbar slots to be free.
	
	BetterHotbar works by testing which hotbar slot of the player is active, by temporarily filling their empty hotbar
	slots with barrier blocks, removing the one which is in the active hotbar slot, and then allowing the player to pick
	up the scythe before finally removing the placeholder barrier blocks, all in the span of 2 ticks.
	
	While a nice quality-of-life feature, this aforementioned process is noticeable when it occurs, and the player can both
	hear and see the barrier blocks being put into their inventory despite their short timespan. Because of this, BetterHotbar
	is off by default, even if BetterInspect has been enabled.
	
	You can turn BetterHotbar off at any time with the command `/scoreboard players reset #ntcs.betterinspect2`
	You can turn BetterHotbar on at any time with the command `/scoreboard players set #ntcs.betterinspect2 ntcs.temp 1`

Debug:
	-To get debug stats, give yourself the tag `ntcs.stats`.
	-If you find a bug or get an error message, please report it to NachoToast.
	-You can reload the datapack using the command `/reload`, this won't affect whether BetterInspect and BetterHotbar are 
	enabled or not, but it should tell you if they are/aren't nonetheless.
	-To give yourself the scythe, run the command `/function ntcs.nachotoast:give`
